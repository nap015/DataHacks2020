Dataset: San Diego Housing Information [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_dTPxfUIFTR_k40Iv5IVX-meTxmWDbL_?usp=sharing)

#### Background Information
> San Diego was a little different 50 years ago from what it is today--the racial distribution of people living in the area is one such example. The Census Bureau collected data from different ‘census tracts’, or small blocks of areas in a city divided for census purposes. These tracts are further divided into smaller ‘blocks’ for more specific divisions. \
We will be using two datasets collected in this time period, that contain information about the same ‘census tract’. The SD1970_population table will contain features like age, gender, race and marital status of San Diego residents in the 1970s, and the SD1970_housing table will contain features like average listing price/monthly rent, number of rooms, and kitchen/plumbing situations of their houses in the same year. The identifying feature for each row will be the tract (“Tract Name”) and block number (“Block Group”) combined, of the represented areas.\
Our goal is to experiment with the data given below and see if there is a common factor among houses with similar living conditions in San Diego, and what kinds of features in the population distribution is associated with features from the housing distribution.

#### Prompt/Rubric
> 1. Cleaning: Clean the dataset in accordance with what rows are relevant to the research\
> 1.1. Dealing with null values, duplicate/ambiguous rows, datatype\
> 1.2. Column Manipulation: lump similar columns together and get rid of unwanted columns. **Add columns “Total Male Persons” and “Total Female Persons” to the population dataframe, and include each column values for the 1st row (Census Tract 1, Block 1) in the report**.\
> 1.3. Data should be optimally cleaned, with similar columns combined together/dropped
> 2. Visualization: Examine the overall distribution of data using different plots\
> 2.1. Plotting: How big is each place (place name)? **What place (place name) is the second most common (group by place name), following San Diego?**\
> 2.2. Pandas: How is the pricing of houses distributed in San Diego? **What's the average price of all houses in San Diego?** Please use the “Total owner occupied average $ value of housing units” column to calculate the answers!\
> 2.3. Pandas: **What place (place name) has the highest average price (based on the owner-occupied average value)?**\
> 2.4. Plotting: Focus on various categories and find out the distribution of various demographics living in San Diego. For example, what's the age distribution for males in San Diego like? What about for females? What's the distribution for individuals with different races living in San Diego, etc.?
> 3. Machine Learning: Use machine learning (linear regression) to see what factors are correlated to the living conditions of houses.\
> 3.1. Define the condition of a house and what columns are relevant to it.\
> 3.2. Does the gender of occupants affect how expensive the house they live in is? What about age? Or marriage status? Perform linear regression on 2 or more features in the population dataset.\
> 3.3. Find a meaningful relationship between the residents of a house and its conditions using different machine learning techniques.
> 4. Analysis - Final Report\
> 4.1. Minimum 2 pages, double spaced, ~12 pt with clear & legible font\
> 4.2. Include all aspects of the 3 steps given above with details on the procedure.\
> 4.3. Must be a clear and concise communication of end results and final analysis\
> 4.4. Minimal grammatical/vocabulary errors and consistent formatting

*Questions in bold will be answered for correctness in the final report!!!*

#### Prompt
> 1. Clean the data. There are quite a few null values and some attributes names are relatively vague. It will help to clean up the data and state your assumptions.
> 2. In a manner, this is a dataset combined from different datasets, and is very open-ended to interpretation.\
> a. Use data visualization tools (Python Libraries, Tableau, etc.) to extract trends and patterns from the data. You must create an infographic with three or more related sections from any topic of interest. \
> b. Are there any questions that are common among different topics? Or do any topics have the same type of questions? Create visualization graphs related to NLP to help present your results.
> 3. Present your results in the form of a research proposal. Explore the data and come up with a hypothesis (i.e. California has a bigger issue with obesity chronic illnesses in comparison to other states). Perform Experimental Testing on your proposal. This will help back up your findings as well.
> 4. Prepare a report containing your results from the analysis. It should contain the following: Intro, data cleaning/pre-processing, visualizations (at least 3), analysis, proposal, conclusion.

Dataset: UBER Travel Time Analysis [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WcLKWilaMjGU-x8ezFVtyVM8-8O-PFIf?usp=sharing)

#### Prompt
> **Part 1**\
> In this track, you will have the opportunity to work with real-world UBER time-series data from the San Francisco area, spanning across the first and second quarters of 2019. The time-series data will be centered on **travel times** for UBER trips in the overall San Francisco area. Before you continue on, please review the metadata below. You will be required to **process**, **visualize**, and **analyze** the data while answering the following questions along the way:
> 1. For every Hotspot, recommend the appropriate BART station to get off of in order to **minimize travel time**. \
> a. Does the appropriate BART station change throughout the day? Throughout the week? 
> 2. Compare and contrast travel times between different BART stations and Hotspots based on these factors: **time of day, day of the week, and the direction of travel**. \
> a. Consider restructuring the data on the basis of some of the previously listed factors.   
> 3. What actionable recommendations are there for riders traveling from unique BART stations to hotspots around the city? What about for tourists planning their way back home from Hotspots to BART stations?


> **Part 2**\
> In the first round, you were mainly interested in gaining a better understanding of the data that was available to you. However, one of the most important roles of a data scientist involves accurately predicting future data. You will now be asked to utilize **machine learning** to predict future UBER travel times on the various BART_Hotspot / Hotspot_BART trips. Using the same data from the first round, complete the following objectives:
> 1. Develop a proposal for how travel times in San Francisco may change in the future? \
> a. Provide justification based on your analysis from the first round as well as any information relevant to the unique nature of time-series data.
> 2. Define a **machine learning model(s)** most appropriate for predicting future trip travel times. Develop datasets with these future travel times for a **minimum of six** BART_to_Hotspot / Hotspot_to_BART trips.\
> a. Consider varying the measure of time (daily, weekly, monthly) used when forecasting future travel times. 
> 3. Prepare and submit a report with visualizations of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience. Consider the following tasks:\
> a. Indicate interesting trends throughout the travel times, both real and predicted. \
> b. Provide recommendations on how UBER can improve travel times to the given Hotspots and/or BART stations.
